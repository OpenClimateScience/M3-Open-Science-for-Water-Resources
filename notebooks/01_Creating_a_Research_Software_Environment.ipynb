    "When research software is used in an analysis, the results of that analysis depend on the software used, including the specific version of that software. To create *reproducible* research using software, we need to clearly identify and communicate all of the software dependencies and their versions. This becomes complicated when we consider how our own software's behavior depends on (open-source) software that other people wrote. A Python program's results may also depend on the version of Python used! **How can we keep track of it all?**\n",
    "\n",
    "[In the previous lesson (link)](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M2-Computational-Climate-Science), we learned how to use the software `pip` to install and manage Python packages. Previously, when we used `pip`, we were installing Python packages to our user directory. The new packages were available to use every time we started Python. Our version of Python and all of the packages we have installed are collectively referred to as our Python *environment.* Every new Python project we start is able to access those same packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This sounds convenient, but there are some downsides.** To understand what can go wrong when several different Python projects use the same *environment,* let's imagine we are about to start a new Python project using code that someone else wrote, a module named `example.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`example.py` uses NumPy **version 1.26.0** to provide some convenient tools for an analysis you want to perform but, on your system, you have NumPy **version 2.0.0** installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `example.py` can only use **version 1.26.0** or earlier, because it uses NumPy's representation of infinity, `np.infty`, which was changed to `np.inf` in **version 2.0.0.** The developer of `example.py` would have to go through all of their code, replacing `np.infty` with `np.inf`, and they don't have the time or interest to do this right now.\n",
    "- On our system, we started a new project where we have to use NumPy **version 2.0.0** because that version added support for a new feature we need. To run `example.py`, we'd have to *downgrade* to **version 1.26.0** and then our new project wouldn't work!\n",

    "### Software versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss the solution to this problem, let's talk about what software version numbers mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two commonly used ways to indicate a software's version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calendar versioning,** where the version number reflects the date of the software's release, usually in `YYYY.MM` format.\n",
    "- **Semantic versioning,** where the version number represents *how different* the new software version is from a previous version.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Semantic versioning** (link)](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200) is the most common. In semantic versioning, a software's version number has three parts, separated by dots:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, NumPy uses semantic versioning when it releases software versions numbered **version 2.0.0** or **version 1.26.0.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first number, the `MAJOR` (\"major\") version number, is used to indicate changes to a software that will almost certainly break any software that depended on a previous major version. Recall our earlier example, where a change from `np.infty` to `np.inf` in NumPy version 2.0.0 would cause `example.py` to break. That's why NumPy's developer increased the major version number from 1 to 2.\n",
    "- The second number, the `MINOR` (\"minor\") version number, is used when new features are added in a *backwards-compatible* manner; i.e., in a way that won't break software that depends on it. In NumPy version 1.26.0, 26 is the minor version number.\n",
    "- The third number, the `PATCH` (\"patch\") version number, is used when we need to release a new version of the software to fix (or to \"patch\") a bug. The new version shouldn't break anything; in fact, it is released specifically to fix a problem with the previous version."

    "Jupyter Notebook makes it possible to work with literate programming documents in a variety of programming languages, not just Python. When you open a Notebook, you can specify the **kernel** that should be used for running any code in that Notebook. The **kernel** is simply the computer program that executes code; it could be the Python intepereter or it could be an interpreter for another language, like R.\n",
