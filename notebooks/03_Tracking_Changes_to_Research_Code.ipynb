Code changes are tracked for a single **repository,** or collection of code, and Git makes it possible to view and go back to previous versions of the repository. Multiple users with access to the same repository can make changes to the code simultaneously and Git helps merge those changes together. A single repository can have multiple copies on different networks, connected over the internet.\n",

And you still benefit from Git's version history.\n",
